        <h2>Film school student</h2>
        <p>Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the <em>State Institute of Cinematography ðŸŽ¥</em> and was admitted to the film-directing program. He was in the same class as <em>Irma Raush</em> whom he married in April 1957.</p>
        <p>The early Khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the <span class="link">Italian neorealists</span>, <span class="link">French New Wave</span>, and of directors such as <em>Kurosawa</em>, <em>BuÃ±uel</em>, <em>Bergman</em>, <em>Bresson</em>, <em>Wajda</em> (whose film Ashes and Diamonds influenced Tarkovsky) and <em>Mizoguchi</em>.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
          <h3>ðŸ’¡ Inspiration</h3>
          <p>Tarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by <em>Japanese films</em>. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight. Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in <em>art of Haiku</em> and its ability to create "images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves"</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Famous Movies</h2>
        <p>Tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director. During his career he directed seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. His features are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ivan's Childhood (1962)</li>
          <li>Andrei Rublev (1966)</li>
          <li>Solaris (1972)</li>
          <li>Mirror (1975)</li>
          <li>Stalker (1979)</li>
          <li>Nostalghia (1983)</li>
          <li>The Sacrifice (1986)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>He also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he directed the play Hamlet for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera Boris Godunov in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story Turnabout by William Faulkner. He also wrote Sculpting in Time, a book on film theory.</p>
        <p>Tarkovsky's <em>first feature film</em> was Ivan's Childhood in 1962. He then directed Andrei Rublev in 1966, Solaris in 1972, Mirror in 1975 and Stalker in 1979. The documentary <em>Voyage in Time</em> was produced in Italy in 1982, as was Nostalghia in 1983. His last film The Sacrifice was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said: <cite>"A director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.""</cite></p>
